#12

Anonymous users can observe but:
  - Don't get a header bar
  - The chat alert is 'null is observing' rather than 'anonymous user is observing'

#15

If you are logged in during server restart and play, your highscore entry has no name

#18

Logging in as a different user does not update continue game / observe correctly on current games display

#24

Anonymous users probably should be able to chat - when observing other people's games

#25

Anonymous users can't watch replays but the link is still there and there is no prompt

#26

Returning to the lobby will kill a replay, even if you go back to the same one afterwards. It would be nicer to keep state

#27

As an observer, viewing the inventory of an observed user would be cool. This will at least an upgrade of the brogue <-> server protocol to support large packets

#28

claris reported that he could control another user's game. Was this after a server reboot?

#30

Lumenstones count should be stored in the database as a separate column

#31

It would be nice to have a winner highscore table which would allow listing by lumenstone

#32

Because the current games don't use BackGrid, the gold is formatted as nicely

#33

It would be cool to share a link to watch a replay, but that would need a way of it working for anon players (which is now OK if the session doesn't persist)

NEXT #35

FIXED

#34

Score still wrapped at 65536 when passed by the server

#29

Games who escape have '0' as their deepest level which doesn't look great

#4

Animations are too fast to be seen (sometimes)

#23

Chat lines can't just be whitespace (happened due to holding down return in chat window).

#22

Users find having to quit replays explicitally confusing

#21

Scores above 65335 are wrapped

#20

Clicking 'Continue Game' in the current games box gives 'Observing <you>' in the header

#19

When a chat window update occurs, you lose current focus, which is annoying when you are typing a message (otherwise not a big deal, since console is default focus)

#1

If you create a new user, that user does not exist but their directory exists, you get:
Server Error: {"errno":-17,"code":"EEXIST","path":"/home/flend/web-brogue/game-data/flend"}
at the client

#17

Seems to be possible to login with local credentials, even if that user has been deleted from the database

#16

You can register with no user name, which is then problematic for others observing your game etc.

#13

If 2 windows are logged in as the same user and the game ends, the high score is recorded twice

#14

Sometimes high scores appear not to be recorded - reason unclear - observed on live server
This turned out to be due to the child process exit event triggering before the event listener had completed

#11

Chat sentence cut off is too short and is cutting off valid sentences

#10

When someone speaks in chat, your input box is cleared

#8

After logging out in another window (?) in-game chat leaks into lobby

#7

The Aries character for foliage bizarrely is always purple on mobile Chrome

#6

Observing a game resets the idle counter

#5

After finishing a game and starting a new one, the 'current games' entry still had the old amount of gold
The front end is receiving the wrong value via WS

#2

The google console font does not have a glyph for:
-Undiscovered items
-Goblin totems

#3

The seed is truncated in the high score table
